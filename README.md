# OSINT on a Landlord  

Being real with y’all, times are tough, and rent ain’t cheap.  

I’ve decided to take a break from renting an apartment and will be leasing a room instead. Yep, that means **roommates.** Not even friends, just random strangers. 😩  

But hey, I know my privilege. Some people have even less to work with, so I’m staying grateful.  

Anyway, this post isn’t about my woes. Let’s get into the real tea.  

I found a place, toured it, and everything seemed fine. But here’s the thing: the person I was communicating with was giving off **scammer vibes.** Let me explain:

## 🚩 Red Flags I Noticed  

1. **No profile picture on the app/false name:**  
   - I understand, but like, why are you hiding? 
   - Also, their name turned out to be fake. Sketchy!  

2. **Out-of-state phone number:**  
   - I get that this isn’t always a dealbreaker, but the area code was from a region *completely* unrelated to the property’s location.  

3. **Owner wasn’t at the property during my visit:**  
   - They told me in advance they wouldn’t be there and had one of the current tenants show me around.  
   - The tenant seemed chill, and the place was nice, so I kept an open mind. Still, I stayed cautious.  

4. **Couldn’t find their LLC in an initial search:**  
   - After some back-and-forth communication (via SMS *only*—red flag right there), they emailed me the lease.  
   - The lease included the name of their LLC. Naturally, I Googled it… and found crickets.  
   - Their private domain name didn’t match the LLC name or even the industry. That part really threw me off.  

At this point, I was like, “Hmm… I don’t know. It’s giving 50/50.”

## 💻 How I Used OSINT to Investigate  

I remembered I’m a *cyber chick*—so I dug a little deeper! Here’s what I did:  

1. **Checked the phone number area code:**  
   - Looked it up! It was for Alaska (not really, but that’s an example).  

2. **Searched for the LLC on official state records:**  
   - A simple Google search wasn’t enough, so I went to the state’s LLC lookup website.  
   - Found the LLC, its creation date, and the registered owner’s name.  

3. **Verified the owner:**  
   - Did a quick Google search of the owner’s name and found consistent details that seemed legit, including their connection to the state.  

4. **Investigated the private domain name:**  
   - Used [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/) to dig into the domain name.  
     - Navigated to **Domain Name > Whois Records > Domain Dossier** and searched the domain.  
   - Found more info that aligned with the other details I’d uncovered.

## 🔑 Outcome  

Based on my research, my confidence in this landlord went from 50% to 95%. I decided to proceed cautiously with the leasing process, ensuring I didn’t hand over personal info too early.
